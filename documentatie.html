        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <h2>Research Tactics</h2>
        <h3>Questionnaire</h3>
        We chose this method of research in order to understand the preferences and requirements of individuals concerning mental health apps. Our goal was to get information about the different ways people manage their mental health based on their mental state. The survey looks for the feature people seem to need the most in order to make our app as helpful and user-friendly as possible.
        That's why, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeeO5WXc_9_fqDqG_qT605OKLf6Tt60HZwzNWnHnYjHQkkSiQ/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank">our questionnaire</a> is structured in 3 parts: "Personal Information", "Mental Health Information" and "The App's Features and Functionality".
        <h3>Competitive Research</h3>
        <p>Competitive analysis is a critical step in the development and implementation of any app. It consists in 
            evaluating the products and strategies of direct competitors in the market. This process helps developers and businesses
             understand the landscape in which they are operating, identifying both opportunities and threats. We have researched multiple apps in order to see which features are most common and the public's opinion on them. In the <a href="./resources/MeHe Competitive Analysis.pdf" target="_blank">attached PDF</a> we've analysed our competitors based on: variety of coping tools, target audience, price structure, customer catisfaction, strengths and weaknesses. 
            <h4>Identifying Target Audiences</h4> 
            <div>
                <p>Understanding who your competitors are targeting can provide insights into market segmentation, helping to pinpoint gaps or opportunities. 
                In the developed research, most apps focus mainly on helping adults and young adults (students), 
                but there are also apps with special features for families with kids and couples. MeHe will focus mainly on teens, students and adults, but it's suited
                for anyone who is looking for some stress relief, clarity and better organizing in their life.</p>
            </div>
            <h4>Assessing Strengths and Weaknesses</h4>
            <div>
            <p> By analyzing what competitors do well and where they fall short, one can better position their app.
                Learning from competitors' strengths allows us to incorporate similar features that work while identifying their weaknesses and presents 
                an opportunity to offer something unique or improved that adds value to users and improves their overall experience.
                The main weaknesses that stood out while analyzing our competitors were complicated and crowded interfaces, hard to use for the average-skilled user.
                Therefore, a simple, clean interface is to be considered for the MeHe app. Also, the apps' glitches and limited free content were brought to our attention as 
                important problems that need to be avoided and taken into consideration in the app's implementation.
                Among the most important strengths that we observed in the analyzed apps were: a high variety of tools, flexibility, and customization
                of the available tools and their offline and free disponibility. </p>
            </div>
            <h4>Learning from Competitor Ratings and Feedback</h4>
            <div>
            <p>User ratings and reviews of competing apps are gold mines of information. They can reveal what users love and dislike,
               helping to avoid common pitfalls and bring innovation and improvement on areas that are less satisfactory. For example, 
               if users complain about the complexity of a competing app, offering a simpler, more user-friendly alternative could provide a competitive edge.</p>
            </div>
            <h4>Comparing Pricing Structures</h4>
            <div>
                <p>All the apps documented in the competitive analysis research require a paid subscription for the user to gain access to the entire variety
                    of coping tools and features. Users often complain about the limited free content available, and also about the high, unaffordable prices for 
                    the subscriptions. The MeHe app will offer free access to the entire stack of functionalities, therefore being suited for everyone's pockets.

            <p>The menu lets the user navigate to the desired feature: events, tasks, reminders, goals, trackers, diary and bookmarks. Also, the setting button lets the user personalise their "Quick Access" board by choosing which features will appear.</p>
            <p>The calendar page will appear after the user clicks on the date in the "Quick Access" page. By swiping the user can navigate towards other monts and years. After clicking the "add button", the user will choose between "event", "task" or "reminder" and will be forwarded to the selected page in order to add a new item </p>
            <p>The "Events" and "Tasks" page are similar, showing the user all the events/tasks inputed chronologicaly, except the ones which are flaged as "Important".

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>In summary, the development of the MeHe app consists in creating a comprehensive mental health companion that is accessible and beneficial 
            to a diverse user base. From the initial research stages, including surveys and competitive analysis, to the detailed design and interaction 
            platforms, every step has been aimed at understanding and addressing the unique mental health needs of individuals. 
            The MeHe app stands out in its market due to its inclusive design and user-first approach, which prioritizes simplicity, accessibility, 
            and the comprehensive nature of its features.
            MeHe is an app designed to support, guide, and enhance the mental well-being of its users every day, and the expected outcome will
            hopefully be seen through the positive impact MeHe will have on its users, empowering them to lead happier, healthier, and more organized lives.</p>
