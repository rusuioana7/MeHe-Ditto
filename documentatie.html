        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>MeHe(Mental Health Companion App) is an app designed to manage and mantain a person's mental well-being. 
            The features vary from helping with daily planning to providing informative media and hosting communities. 
            The app encourages the user to plan their day in a productive way by tracking upcoming events, task and setting reminders for them, access different types of  relaxation techniques, informative articles and tips and connect with others through communities.</p>

        <h3>Questionnaire</h3>
        <h3>Competitive Research</h3>
        <p>Competitive analysis is a critical step in the development and implementation of any app. It consists in 
            evaluating the products and strategies of direct competitors in the market. This process helps developers and businesses
             understand the landscape in which they are operating, identifying both opportunities and threats. 
            <h4>Identifying Target Audiences</h4> 
            <div>
                <p>Understanding who your competitors are targeting can provide insights into market segmentation, helping to pinpoint gaps or opportunities. 
                In the developed research, most apps focus mainly on helping adults and young adults (students), 
                but there are also apps with special features for families with kids and couples. MeHe will focus mainly on teens, students and adults, but it's suited
                for anyone who is looking for some stress relief, clarity and better organizing in their life.</p>
            </div>
            <h4>Assessing Strengths and Weaknesses</h4>
            <div>
            <p> By analyzing what competitors do well and where they fall short, one can better position their app.
                Learning from competitors' strengths allows us to incorporate similar features that work while identifying their weaknesses and presents 
                an opportunity to offer something unique or improved that adds value to users and improves their overall experience.
                The main weaknesses that stood out while analyzing our competitors were complicated and crowded interfaces, hard to use for the average-skilled user.
                Therefore, a simple, clean interface is to be considered for the MeHe app. Also, the apps' glitches and limited free content were brought to our attention as 
                important problems that need to be avoided and taken into consideration in the app's implementation.
                Among the most important strengths that we observed in the analyzed apps were: a high variety of tools, flexibility, and customization
                of the available tools and their offline and free disponibility. </p>
            </div>
            <h4>Learning from Competitor Ratings and Feedback</h4>
            <div>
            <p>User ratings and reviews of competing apps are gold mines of information. They can reveal what users love and dislike,
               helping to avoid common pitfalls and bring innovation and improvement on areas that are less satisfactory. For example, 
               if users complain about the complexity of a competing app, offering a simpler, more user-friendly alternative could provide a competitive edge.</p>
            </div>
            <h4>Comparing Pricing Structures</h4>
            <div>
                <p>All the apps documented in the competitive analysis research require a paid subscription for the user to gain access to the entire variety
                    of coping tools and features. Users often complain about the limited free content available, and also about the high, unaffordable prices for 
                    the subscriptions. The MeHe app will offer free access to the entire stack of functionalities, therefore being suited for everyone's pockets.
