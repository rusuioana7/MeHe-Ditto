She feels left behind in class and has to study a lot to barely keep up with everybody else. Bianca suffers from chronic back pain, that’s why she needs a reminder to take a break and stretch her back. Bianca also deals with social anxiety, that’s why she would use breathing exercises and meditation to help her feel more relaxed and comfortable in social settings. She wants an app that could help her deal better with all the stress she’s experiencing, help her stay active in spite of all the computer work she needs to get done and relax her mind and body at the end of a long school day.</p>
